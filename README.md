This is my tic-tac-toe.

This is a straight forward version of the game that is designed to take certain
conditions and check them using a grid method. Ordered pairs check agains a game
engine in order to see if victory, defeat, or ties are achieved.

The API allows for the user to sign in, sign out, and save their game stats on a
move by move basis. This condition allows for further developement ot open up
former games and allow for different styles all round.

I followed this schedule and performed to try and complete the task:
Step 1, find a few tools to help you plan and stay on track.
    A Apps
    B Index Cards
    C Sketchbook
Step 2
  A Sketch rough wireframes of the front end
  B Write User stories
Step 3
   A Model the app/entities use wireframes and user stories to drive my model.
   B Ask â€œwhat things are interacting with what?
Step 4
    A Create a repo of what your project will use.
    B Create a ReadMe for that.
Step5
    A Create a Simple Front End HTML
    B Create a Simple CSS
    C Create a Host on GitHub
Step 6
    A Create Game Logic
Step 7
    A Test Curl and API
    B Update as Needed


The User stories I worked with are:

As a user I want to be able to sign in and out.

As a user I want to be able to see previous games.

As a user I want to be able to play a new game without having a new window pop up.

As a user, I want to be able to choose my icon.

After some considerable work through, I have been able to do most of what I need.
Unfortunately, there are still some factors that do not work still.

Additionally this is the model I used for my original project.
